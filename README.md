We often have lot on our mind when we wake up and thinking that we would complete all our tasks by the end of the day
and we forget to do most of them sometimes. So I thought why don't we manage those tasks with the help of a to-do list.
So here is my TodoList you can try managing your tasks with the help of it: TodoList

# Features
1. Can Add Tasks
2. Modify (Rename the tasks)
3. Update the tasks (if done)
4. Delete all the Tasks (clear the tasks from the list)
5. It gives the total count of the tasks
6. And if there are many, you can scroll them

# How to use 

Here's how you can use the TodoList to manage your tasks efficiently:

1. Add Tasks: Enter your task in the input field and click the "Add" button to add it to the list.
