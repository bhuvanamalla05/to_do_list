We often have lot on our mind when we wake up and thinking that we would complete all our tasks by the end of the day
and we forget to do most of them sometimes. So I thought why don't we manage those tasks with the help of a to-do list.
So here is my TodoList you can try managing your tasks with the help of it: TodoList

3. Update the tasks (if done)
4. Delete all the Tasks (clear the tasks from the list)
5. It gives the total count of the tasks
